We have 3 files with similar functions which show our process for improving the efficiency of SDTW. We are keeping these files because they can be used in different contexts.

Source code:
- dtw_soft.py (Pytorch SDTW implementation)
- DTWLoss.py (Pytorch loss function)
- DTWLoss_CUDA.py (Pytorch loss function Compatible GPU)

notebook:
- Anomaly detection (section 4.1 and 4.4)
- Experiments section (section 4.2 and 4.3)
